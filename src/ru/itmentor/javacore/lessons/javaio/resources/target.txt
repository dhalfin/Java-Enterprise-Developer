if
we
want
to
know
where
our
capability
for
complex
language
came
from
we
need
to
look
at
how
our
brains
are
different
from
other
animals
this
relates
to
more
than
just
brain
size
it
is
important
what
other
things
our
brains
can
do
and
when
and
why
they
evolved
that
way
and
for
this
there
are
very
few
physical
clues
artefacts
left
by
our
ancestors
dont
tell
us
what
speech
they
were
capable
of
making
one
thing
we
can
see
in
the
remains
of
early
humans
however
is
the
development
of
the
mouth
throat
and
tongue
by
about
100000
years
ago
humans
had
evolved
the
ability
to
create
complex
sounds
before
that
evolutionary
biologists
can
only
guess
whether
or
not
early
humans
communicated
using
more
basic
sounds
we
know
that
human
language
is
far
more
complex
than
that
of
even
our
nearest
and
most
intelligent
relatives
like
chimpanzees
we
can
express
complex
thoughts
convey
subtle
emotions
and
communicate
about
abstract
concepts
such
as
past
and
future
and
we
do
this
following
a
set
of
structural
rules
known
as
grammar
do
only
humans
use
an
innate
system
of
rules
to
govern
the
order
of
words
perhaps
not
as
some
research
may
suggest
dolphins
share
this
capability
because
they
are
able
to
recognise
when
these
rules
are
broken
